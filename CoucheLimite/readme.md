the calculate of boundary layer based on shooting method
## [Blasius](Blasius.mlx)
Resolution of function $f'''+\frac{1}{2} f \,f" =0$.
Base case:
Calculate of boundary layer of a bord in front of a parallel flow.
## [Falkner-Skan](Falkner-Skan.mlx)
Resolution of function $f'''+\frac{m+1}{2} f \,f" +m[1-(f')^2]=0$.
This can explain the case where there is a gradient of pression. In fact, when $m=0$, we goes back to blasius case.
## [Potentiel-Paroi](Potentiel-Paroi.mlx)
Resolution of function $1+f'''+f \,f" -f'f'=0$.
This can explain the case where there is a potential flow going to a bord.
